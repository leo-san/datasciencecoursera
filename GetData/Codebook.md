Codebook for the data set tidy.txt 

The data set is derived from the data set Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.
Original data due to Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.(Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory at DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.)

This data set contains data from smartphones carried by 30 subjects performing six
different actvities:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
For each combination of subject and activity, 66 different features are provided.
The features are mean and standard deviation of different components of sensor signals, in time domain and in frequency domain, 
recorded by the smartphones carried by the subjects. Each feature is an average over a number of observations of each subject performing each activity. 
The features are normalized and take values in [-1,1].
Brief descriptions of the features are given in the table below. For more detailed information
about the smartphone signals and how the experiment was carried out, the reader is referred to information here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
